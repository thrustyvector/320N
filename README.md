# Aircraft Maintenance Blockchain Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Aircraft Maintenance Blockchain project! This project utilizes blockchain technology to enhance and streamline aircraft maintenance processes. Smart contracts written in Solidity govern the maintenance procedures, and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The communication between the frontend and smart contracts is facilitated by Web3.js. The deployment is managed using the Truffle framework and hosted on a local server powered by Ganache.

## Introduction

Aircraft maintenance is a critical aspect of ensuring the safety and reliability of aviation operations. This project leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency, traceability, and security in the aircraft maintenance process. Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce maintenance protocols, while the frontend offers an intuitive user interface for interacting with these contracts.

## Features

- **Transparent Maintenance History**: All maintenance activities are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent maintenance history for each aircraft.

- **Decentralized Record Keeping**: Blockchain ensures that maintenance records are stored in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner, reducing the risk of data manipulation.

- **Automated Maintenance Protocols**: Smart contracts automatically execute predefined maintenance protocols when triggered, reducing the need for manual intervention.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend is designed with a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction with the blockchain, allowing users to view maintenance history and trigger maintenance procedures.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contracts are written in Solidity, a language specifically designed for Ethereum.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: These technologies are used to build the frontend, providing a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

- **Web3.js**: This JavaScript library allows seamless communication between the frontend and smart contracts.

- **Truffle Framework**: Truffle is used for development, testing, and deployment of the smart contracts.

- **Ganache**: Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, and it's used for local deployment and testing.
